## API Versions

The Canvas REST API supports versioning through the `/api/v{version}` URL prefix. Currently, two API versions are available:

- **V2 (Current)**: The latest stable version, featuring enhanced performance and expanded functionality. All new integrations should use this version.
- **V1 (Deprecated)**: Legacy version maintained for existing integrations. This version will be discontinued soon.

:::warning

For backwards compatibility with already existing integrations, route `/api` automatically redirects to the `/api/v1` endpoint.

## V1 API Endpoints

The V1 API has been deprecated. While still accessible, we strongly recommend migrating to V2 API for all new and existing integrations. For historical reference, the V1 API documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/CraftCanvasMC/Website/blob/bd804056306e713da89ebe56132e58702119ba4a/api/DOCUMENTATION.md).
