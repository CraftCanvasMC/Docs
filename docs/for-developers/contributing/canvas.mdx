## Introduction

This guide will help you get started with contributing to CanvasMC server.

:::warn

Paper-based servers are optimized for Linux environments. While development on Windows is possible, we only provide support for Linux.

:::

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- For Windows users, WSL2.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) with configured credentials.

### WSL2 Configuration

For Windows users, Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) provides an Linux development environment. If you have WSL2 configured or are using a native Linux/macOS system, proceed to the next section.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open Command Prompt as Administrator and enable WSL 2 with the following commands:

    ```bash
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
    ```
    
    Restart your computer to apply these changes.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Install Ubuntu or any other preferred Linux distribution via Microsoft Store or command line:

    ```bash
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
    ```

    When prompted, set up your Linux username and password. These credentials will be used for sudo commands.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Local Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Update your system packages to ensure everything is current:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Install SDKMAN! for Java version management:

    ```bash
    curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
    source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Install Eclipse Temurin JDK 22:

    ```bash
    sdk install java 22.0.2+9-temurin
    ```

    :::info

    Alternative JDK providers may impact performance and compilation speed.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    Clone the Canvas Repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CraftCanvasMC/Canvas.git
    cd Canvas
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Import the cloned Canvas project into IntelliJ IDEA.

    :::warning
    
    While other IDEs can be used, IntelliJ IDEA provides the best Java development experience with superior code analysis, debugging tools, and Gradle integration.
    
    :::
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Make sure you have Git configured with your credentials:

    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Set up your development environment by applying Paper, Purpur and Canvas patches:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew applyAllPatches
    ```

    This command prepares the codebase by applying all necessary patches to the Minecraft server, making it ready for development.
  </Step>
