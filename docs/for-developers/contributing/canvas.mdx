## Introduction

This guide presents the essential steps for configuring a CanvasMC development environment on Windows.

:::warn

Paper-based servers are optimized for Linux. While Windows development is possible, we strongly recommend WSL2 for optimal performance.

:::

## Environment Setup

### Configuration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Enable WSL 2 using these commands in PowerShell (Administrator):
    ```bash
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
    wsl --set-default-version 2
    ```
    Restart your system afterward.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Obtain Ubuntu via Microsoft Store or command line:
    ```bash
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
    ```
    Configure credentials when prompted.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Ensure your system is current:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Deploy SDKMAN! for Java version management:
    ```bash
    curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
    source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Install Eclipse Temurin JDK 22:
    ```bash
    sdk install java 22.0.2+9-temurin
    ```
    :::info

    Alternative JDK providers may impact performance and compilation speed.

  <Step>
    Clone the Canvas Repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/CraftCanvasMC/Canvas.git
    cd Canvas
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Import the cloned Canvas project using IntelliJ IDEA (or other IDE's but really IntelliJ is the best out there).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Initialize the development environment:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew applyAllPatches
    ```
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Contributing

After making changes to the source code:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Rebuild patches (using the bash script in the root of the repo) to update the project:
    ```bash
    ./rebuildPatches
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: describe your changes"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Push your changes and create a Pull Request on GitHub:
