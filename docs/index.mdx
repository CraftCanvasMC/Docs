## What is CanvasMC?

CanvasMC is a high-performance Minecraft server software focused on maximizing server performance while maintaining plugin compatibility. Built on top of [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/), it implements various experimental optimizations to achieve significant performance improvements.

### Key Features

- Multithreaded Dimension Ticking (MDT)
- Chunk Generation Optimizations
- Command Optimizations
- Entity Improvements

## Who is CanvasMC for?

First of all, CanvasMC requires a lot of configuration in order to achieve optimal performance. By default, it is not using its full potential as most optimizations are hardware dependent.

Before you start using CanvasMC, make sure you know what you are doing. If you are not sure, you can join our [Discord Server](https://canvasmc.io/discord) and ask for help.
