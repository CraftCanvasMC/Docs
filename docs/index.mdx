## What is CanvasMC?

**CanvasMC** is a fork of the Folia Minecraft server software that fixes gameplay inconsistencies, bugs, and introduces further performance enhancements to the dedicated server.

Folia itself is broken. It breaks numerous vanilla mechanics and systems, APIs for plugin developers, and more. Canvas aims to fix these issues to provide a stable and reliable
server environment for people to use when working with threaded regionizing

Canvas is ***not*** a drop in replacement for Purpur, Paper, Leaf, or even V2/V1 of itself. Canvas V3 is a fork of Folia, and only is a drop in replacement for Folia or other forks of Folia.

Folia forks themselves are complete garbage most of the time. They disable thread checks, and try and aim for adding more plugin compatibility, which ends up meaning they will bend
the new rules Folia makes, or disregard them entirely, leaving for an unstable environment to work with given there are no safe guards. Canvas tries to steer away from these
forks and abide by the rules Folia has made, and try and fix and improve the software while abiding by the new rules. There will be no exceptions for when we will disable
these checks or bend the rules, **ever**.
