# Canvas Multithreading
This page discusses and outlines Canvas' most significant changes to the Minecraft server to bring various threading optimizations.

## Chunks/Moonrise
Moonrise is PaperMCs chunk system rewrite that introduces "async" operations to the chunk system. Moonrise however, is flawed in numerous ways that stunt performance and scalability. For example:
- Broken scaling
- Async/Sync task filtering
- Max parallelism

Moonrise scaling completely falls apart at ~8 threads. With Moonrise, certain chunk steps are filtered as "parallel-safe" or not.
This defines whether the chunk system can run the task on a worker thread, or on the main thread. Most chunk tasks are handled on workers
except a few. `LIGHT`, `SPAWN`, `FEATURES`, and `FULL`.
By making some tasks run on the main thread, it slows down productivity when loading/generating chunks. Canvas changes this to make
all chunk steps marked as "parallel-safe". The tasks mentioned however, are not parallel-safe, so Canvas implements various fixes to
make these steps thread-safe, which boosts productivity with worker threads, implementing some patches from C2ME to fix various worldgen bugs.

Unfortunately, that only does so much to improve performance of the chunk system, and we still have various issues causing the chunk system to
extremely under-perform. When building Moonrise executors``(interfaces into the worker thread pool)``, it sets the configuration option of `max-parallelism`.
This configuration option essentially limits how many threads can process a specific task type on that thread, meaning only 1 thread can execute a singular
chunk step at a time. This is the main source for why Moonrise doesn't linearly scale properly.
What Canvas does to combat this, is remove max parallelism entirely, allowing any and all workers to run any of a specific task type at once.
This does cause numerous issues, which is why Moonrise didn't do this already. Canvas fixes these issues allowing a fully threaded chunk system with proper
linear scaling.

Canvas also implements its own worker pool called `TheChunkSystem` class. This class interfaces with `FlowSched`, a collection of scheduling implementations
created by ishland, one of the devs of C2ME. The new chunk system changes allow Canvas to fully utilize all threads allocated in a much more efficient and optimal way.

## Tickloops

There is a very big problem with Minecraft that creates a hard-ceiling with performance opportunities. Vanilla Minecraft is built to be almost fully single-threaded
which leaves performance scalability extremely difficult. Various mods and server forks have attempted to fix this bottle-neck but most either were extremely unstable
or failed entirely. Most notably, Folia and C2ME being far more stable and impressive than all others. Folia, despite being unstable still, is created by optimization
legend, SpottedLeaf. Folia implements regionized ticking to make Minecraft truly scale and is the closest attempt to a truly threaded Minecraft server.
Canvas attempts to try and become more of a "middle ground" between Paper and Folia, and aiming for Vanilla mechanics compatibility, unlike Folia which disables certain mechanics.
Canvas does this by threading per world, instead of per region, and implements more threading optimizations to allow the server to scale more efficiently.

Canvas threads the server in a few ways, by world(known internally as the ``ServerLevel``), network phases, and the chunk system. Canvas, similar to Folia, runs ticks
inside a scheduler thread pool, so we can allocate a specific amount of threads for ticking the server, rather than dedicate threads to specific tickloops like the main thread.
Canvas also exposes this API allowing plugins to create tickloops that are ticked in parallel with the server.

### Level Threading
Canvas' main optimization is isolated ticking of the world off the main thread. Each world becomes it's own "main thread", and is ticked on the scheduler in parallel.
All things related to the world and it's tick are isolated on there to prevent concurrency issues, however there are a few rules that Canvas threading follows:
- All commands are processed on the main thread. For commands that interact with the world, Canvas has made thread-safe so the server doesn't crash when running the `tp` command for example.
- Connections/Packet processing is handled on the level of which the player is associated on. Instead of the main thread, Canvas queues packet processing tasks to the connection
object that is associated with the player, the `ServerGamePacwketListenerImpl`. More information on networking handling is bellow. All packets are processed before the world is ticked.
- Anything and everything related to the world tick is processed on that thread. Canvas also implements the Folia regionized scheduler to allow plugins to use that to schedule on the
associated world thread.

### Chunk Threading
As mentioned previously, Canvas fixes linear scaling with the chunk system, supercharging chunk performance. However, there are still some things processed on the main thread
related to the chunk system, that make the chunk system not fully async. To combat this, we made a "async chunk loader" thread, that ticks in parallel, and processes the following:
- Distance Manager ticket purging
- PlayerChunkLoader ticking, which updates queues associated with chunk system steps(load, generate, send, etc)
- ChunkTaskScheduler main thread ticking, which processes any scheduled tasks for the main thread
- Chunk update broadcasting
- ChunkMap ticking
- Distance Manager ticking

In general, this thread keeps track of all things related to the chunk system, making the entirety of Moonrise completely async, and keeps everything in check.

### Network Threading
During the player configuration and joining phases, the server runs some blocking tasks related to establishing connections with the client, which can hurt performance immensely,
often tanking MSPT from ~3 -> 500+ from 1 player joining, and is even worse when multiple players are joining at once. To help reduce this lag, we move the configuration and joining
phases of the player connection to the "async join thread", ticking in parallel with the server and isolates the blocking tasks to minimize lag on the rest of the server.
