# Long-Term Support (LTS) Policy

## Overview
Our LTS policy ensures continued support for previous versions while maintaining focus on the latest developments. Below are the specific support guidelines:

## Support Duration
- **Previous Minor Version:**
  The last minor version before a new release will be supported for **1 month** after the first build of the latest version is available.
  - Example: If `1.21.5` is released, then `1.21.4` will be supported for 1 month after the first `1.21.5` build is deployed.

- **Previous Major Version:**
  The latest minor version of the previous major version will be supported **until the next update cycle**.
  - Example: If `1.22` is released, then `1.21.(latest)` will be supported until `1.22.1` is released.

## Additional Notes
- **Critical Fix Updates:**
  Critical fixes from Minecraft itself **do not** affect this policy. If a critical fix update is released, it will be considered as the same as the update it associates with(like 1.21 and 1.21.1 would be considered the same).
- **Feature Backporting:**
  New features will **only** be available on the latest version and **will not** be backported.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  Only **bug fixes** will be provided for LTS versions.

This policy ensures a balance between stability for existing users and continued progress on the latest version.
