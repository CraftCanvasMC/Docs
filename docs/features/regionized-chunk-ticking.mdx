## Basics

Regionized chunk ticking basically means that different areas of the world are ticked at the same time instead of one after another.

This may sound similar another server software you may have heard of called [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia).
While the general idea is similar, the two softwares go about it in completely different ways. If you'd like to read up on how Folia does it, they have [docs page](https://docs.papermc.io/folia/reference/region-logic)!

The way Canvas handles RCT is much more simple. Every tick, all currently ticked chunks are compiled, and then split into as many non-connected groups as possible.
Once all the groups are made, the server just starts the process of ticking them all at once instead of one after the other.
While not as fast as Folia's system, it's much simpler and more compatible with the plugins you're already use to using!

<Callout type='warn'>
    **Regionized Chunk Ticking** is new and may be unstable. If you encounter any issues while RCT is enabled be sure to report them ASAP.

    RCT could also potentially cause plugin compatability issues, if something breaks make sure to test it with RCT off!

Canvas' implementation of Regionized Chunk Ticking is actually far simpler than you may expect, there were really just 2 problems we had to solve.

### Grouping Chunks
For the first problem, the current code was actually nice enough to pass a list of chunks to tick to another function, so we just took that list and split it up!
The algorithm that was decided on was [Depth-first Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search), and is run from scratch every tick.

Basically, DFS recursively goes through every chunk, adding it to a group until it finds no more connected and non-visited chunks. Then it starts over with the next non-visited chunk until all chunks have been processed.
Assuming you store those groups in some sort of list, you have successfully seperated one list into multiple lists of isolated chunks!

### Ticking Chunks
Ticking things in parallel can often cause many headaches. Lucky for us however, the way we handle grouping of the chunks actually takes most of the risk out of parallelizing this!
Due to touching chunks always being in the same group, you can guarantee that regions will have at least one chunk of space between them. Since regions are also remade every tick, you only need to worry about interactions on this current tick.
There's not much, if anything, that can actually interact with two different and seperated chunks on the same tick so as long as you catch those edge cases you're safe to parallelize away!

### Canvas vs Folia
If you know anything about Folia, you may notice a crucial difference when using RCT. Every region in Folia is ticked fully independently, very similarly to how Canvas ticks every world independently.
This means that if one region is lagging, the others don't care. Canvas however waits for every region to finish its tasks before it starts the next tick, making the overall tick be as slow as the slowest region.
It's designed this way due to the fact that regions are remade every tick. This means that if you don't wait for every region to finish its tick you run the risk of having chunks ticked a second time before they finish (or even start) their first tick.

The inspiration for this design came from [Low Level Game Dev's](https://www.youtube.com/@lowlevelgamedev9330) video [Making Minecraft but the server is Optimized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f0uH33X6ko).
