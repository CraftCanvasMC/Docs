# Long-Term Support (LTS) Policy

## Overview
We follow a simple LTS policy: **only the latest version available on the downloads API of Minecraft is supported**. This ensures users always receive updates, fixes, and features aligned with the most recent Minecraft release.

## Support Scope
- **Only Latest Version Supported:**
  As soon as a new Minecraft version is released, support for all previous versions is immediately dropped.

## Additional Notes
- **No Backports:**
  New features and fixes will only be available on the latest supported version. We do not backport features or bug fixes to previous versions.
- **Critical Fixes:**
  Fixes are only provided for the latest supported version, even if older versions receive critical updates from upstream

This approach keeps our development focused, reduces technical debt, and ensures the highest level of performance and compatibility for end users.
