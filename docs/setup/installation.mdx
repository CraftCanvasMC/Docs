## Requirements

- Java 22 or newer
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- Stable internet connection
- Basic command line knowledge

## Installation

The process of installing CanvasMC is pretty straightforward. Follow these steps carefully to get your server up and running smoothly.

### Download Server

1. Get the latest CanvasMC jar file from [canvasmc.io/downloads](https://canvasmc.io/downloads)
2. Create a new directory for your server files
3. Move the downloaded jar file to your server directory
4. **Optional**: Rename the jar file to `canvas.jar` for easier reference

### Initial Setup

1. Open terminal or command prompt in your server directory
2. Start the server with the following command:
   ```bash
   java -jar canvas.jar nogui
   ```
   The server will crash on first run - this is expected behavior as it generates necessary files.
3. Accept EULA:
   - Server creates `eula.txt` file ([End User License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement))
   - Open the file and change `eula` to `true`
     ```bash title="eula.txt"
     #By changing the setting below to TRUE you are indicating your agreement to our EULA (https://aka.ms/MinecraftEULA).
     #Mon Jan 27 14:03:24 CET 2025
     eula=false # [!code --]
     eula=true # [!code ++]
     ```
4. Start the server once again and congrats! You have successfully installed CanvasMC.

## Configuration

The server automatically generates default configuration files on first run. These files contain various server settings that you can customize. See our detailed [configuration guide](./config) for all available customization options and recommended settings.
