## Requirements

To run CanvasMC, you'll need:

- [Java 22](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=22) or newer
- At least 4GB of RAM (recommended)
- A stable internet connection

## Installation

CanvasMC follows a similar installation process to other PaperMC-based server software, making it familiar for experienced server administrators.

### Download the Server

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Download Latest Release**
    Visit [canvasmc.io/downloads](https://canvasmc.io/downloads) to get the newest version of CanvasMC.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Create Server Directory** 
    Make a new folder to keep your server files organized and easily accessible.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Install Server Files**
    Move the downloaded CanvasMC jar file into your server directory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Initial Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **First Server Launch**
    Open a terminal or command prompt in your server directory and run:
    ```bash
    java -jar canvas.jar nogui
    ```
    <Callout type="info">
      The server will exit after first launch - this is expected as it generates required configuration files.
    </Callout>
    
    <Callout type="info">
      We recommend using optimized JVM flags from [flags.sh](https://flags.sh).
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Accept the EULA**
    The first launch creates an `eula.txt` file. Open it and change `eula=false` to `eula=true`:
    ```bash title="eula.txt"
    # By changing the setting below to TRUE, you agree to our EULA (https://aka.ms/MinecraftEULA).
    # Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 UTC 1970
    eula=false # [!code --]
    eula=true # [!code ++]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Complete Installation**
    Run the server command again to start CanvasMC. Once it fully loads, your installation is complete!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

CanvasMC generates default configuration files during the first launch. These files allow you to customize various aspects of your server. For detailed information about available options and recommended settings, check our [configuration guide](./config).
