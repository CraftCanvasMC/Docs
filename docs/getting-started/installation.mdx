## Requirements

To run CanvasMC, you'll need:

- [Java 22](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=22) or newer
- At least 4GB of RAM (recommended)
- A stable internet connection

## Installation

CanvasMC follows a similar installation process to other PaperMC-based server software, making it familiar for experienced server administrators.

### Downloading the Server

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Visit [canvasmc.io/downloads](https://canvasmc.io/downloads) to get the newest version of CanvasMC.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    Make a new folder to keep your server files organized and easily accessible.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Move the downloaded CanvasMC jar file into your server directory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Running the Server

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open a terminal or command prompt in your server directory and run:
    ```bash title="console"
    java -jar canvas.jar nogui # [!code word:canvas.jar] replace the jar file with the one you downloaded
    ```
    <Callout type="info">
      The server will exit after first launch - this is expected as it generates required configuration files.
    </Callout>
    
    <Callout type="info">
      We recommend using optimized JVM flags from [flags.sh](https://flags.sh).
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    The first launch creates an `eula.txt` file. Open it and change `eula=false` to `eula=true`:
    ```bash title="eula.txt"
    # By changing the setting below to TRUE, you agree to our EULA (https://aka.ms/MinecraftEULA).
    # Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 UTC 1970
    eula=false # [!code --]
    eula=true # [!code ++]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Run the server command again to start CanvasMC. Once it fully loads, your installation is complete!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you have your CanvasMC server running, you can start adding plugins and configuring it to your liking.
