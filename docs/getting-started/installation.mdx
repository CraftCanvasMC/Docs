## Requirements

To run CanvasMC, you'll need:

- [Java 22](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=22) or newer
- At least 4GB of RAM (recommended)
- A stable internet connection

## Installation

CanvasMC follows a similar installation process to other PaperMC-based server software, making it familiar for experienced server administrators.

### Downloading the Server

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Visit [canvasmc.io/downloads](https://canvasmc.io/downloads) to get the newest version of CanvasMC.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    Make a new folder to keep your server files organized and easily accessible.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Move the downloaded CanvasMC jar file into your server directory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Running the Server

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a startup script for your operating system:

    ```bash title="start.bat (Windows)"
    java -Xms2G -Xmx4G -jar canvas.jar nogui
    pause
    ```

    ```bash title="start.sh (Linux/macOS)"
    #!/bin/bash
    java -Xms2G -Xmx4G -jar canvas.jar nogui
    ```
    
    <Callout type="info">
      For optimal performance, get customized JVM flags from [flags.sh](https://flags.sh) based on your server specs.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    The first launch creates an `eula.txt` file. Open it and change the following line:

    ```bash title="eula.txt"
    # By changing the setting below to TRUE, you agree to our EULA (https://aka.ms/MinecraftEULA).
    # Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 UTC 1970
    eula=false # [!code --]
    eula=true # [!code ++]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Run the server again using the startup script you created. Once it fully loads, your installation is complete!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you have your CanvasMC server running, you can start adding plugins and configuring it to your liking.
