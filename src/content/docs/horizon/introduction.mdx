## Introduction

Horizon is a MIXIN wrapper for PaperMC servers and forks, expanding plugin capabilities to allow for further
customization and enhancements.

Horizon acts more like a replacement wrapper for Paperclip (the launcher for Paper servers and forks). It boots the game in
a very similar way, as it contains an iteration of the Paperclip launcher. Please read the sections below to
learn more about how Horizon works and how to develop with it.

Horizon supports all versions of Minecraft newer than `1.20.6`, and also supports snapshots, pre-releases, and release-candidates.

## Background
Horizon is a project that is intended to supersede a project by one of the core team members(Dueris), the project
Eclipse. Eclipse was a plugin for Paper based on the program Ignite that allowed loading SpongePowered Mixins, access
wideners, and transformers. Eclipse and Ignite code are contained within Horizon since obviously, Horizon supersedes
Eclipse, and as such has a similar concept and similar/derived code, and Eclipse is based on/forked from Ignite directly.
This project, of course, had many issues and drawbacks that made Eclipse difficult to work with most of the time. And
so, Dueris archived the project and decided to create Horizon, which is the successor of Eclipse.

Horizon intends to fix the issues from Eclipse and create a more manageable, workable, and stable environment for
plugins to work with, while incorporating plugin authors' ideas in a much more powerful and flexible manner.
