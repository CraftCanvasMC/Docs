Horizon is simple to install and get running. You can download Horizon from our website, https://canvasmc.io, and from
there it is as simple as dropping the downloaded JAR file
into the *same directory* as your server JAR. **DO NOT REPLACE THE SERVER JAR!!** Horizon works as an external wrapper
for the server JAR, so the server JAR needs to be present for Horizon
to function correctly. The default file Horizon will search for is `server.jar`, which is configurable wth the
`horizon.yml` configuration file:

```yaml
pluginsDirectory: plugins
serverJar: server.jar
cacheLocation: cache/horizon
extraPlugins: [ ]
serverName: horizon
```

This `horizon.yml` file is intended for more extensive configuration of Horizon, allowing setting the server JAR name,
since not all servers will have their server JAR named `server.jar`, or you can then
have multiple server JARs and swap between the target Horizons they use.

- The `cacheLocation` is simply for storing JIJ plugins and such, and is cleared on each boot of Horizon. We don't
  recommend changing it, but you can if there are conflicts or some issue
  arises, and you need to change the location.
- The option `extraPlugins` allows for adding additional plugins to the Horizon classpath to be loaded. Horizon also
  reads from the `--add-plugin` JVM argument that is passed to the server
- The `serverName` option is an optional override for the server mod name, as it gets overridden in Horizon
  automatically by its internal mixin inject
- The `pluginsDirectory` option should always point to your plugins directory for both Paper plugins and Horizon
  plugins; however, you can separate them if you need or want to.

Once all options are configured to your liking, you can boot the Horizon JAR as usual, and your server will run with
Horizon as its bootstrapper!
