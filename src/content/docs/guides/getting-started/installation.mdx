## Requirements

To run CanvasMC, you'll need:

- [Java 21](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=21) or newer
- At least 4GB of RAM (recommended)
- A stable internet connection

## Installation

CanvasMC follows a similar installation process to other PaperMC-based server software, making it familiar for experienced server administrators.

### Downloading the Server

<ul>
  <li>
    Visit [canvasmc.io/downloads](https://canvasmc.io/downloads) to get the newest version of CanvasMC.
  </li>

  <li>
    Make a new folder to keep your server files organized and easily accessible.
  </li>

  <li>
    Move the downloaded CanvasMC jar file into your server directory.
  </li>
</ul>

### Running the Server

<ul>
  <li>
    Create a startup script for your operating system:

    ```bash tab="Windows" title="start.bat"
    java -Xms2G -Xmx4G --add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector -jar canvas.jar --nogui
    pause >nul 2>&1
    ```

    ```bash tab="Linux/macOS" title="start.sh"
    #!/bin/bash
    java -Xms2G -Xmx4G --add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector -jar canvas.jar --nogui
    pause > /dev/null 2>&1
    ```

    :::info

    For optimal performance, get customized JVM flags from [Birdflop Flags Generator](https://www.birdflop.com/resources/flags/) based on your server specs.

    :::
  </li>

  <li>
    The first launch creates an `eula.txt` file. Open it and change the following line:

    ```diff title="eula.txt"
    # By changing the setting below to TRUE, you agree to our EULA (https://aka.ms/MinecraftEULA).
    # Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 UTC 1970
    - eula=false
    + eula=true
    ```
  </li>

  <li>
    Run the server again using the startup script you created. Once it fully loads, your installation is complete!
  </li>
</ul>

## Next Steps

Now that you have your CanvasMC server running, you can start adding plugins and configuring it to your liking.
