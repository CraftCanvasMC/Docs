## What is CanvasMC?

**CanvasMC** is a fork of the Folia Minecraft server software that fixes gameplay inconsistencies, bugs, and introduces further performance enhancements to the dedicated server.

Folia itself is broken. It breaks numerous vanilla mechanics and systems, APIs for plugin developers, and more. Canvas aims to fix these issues to provide a stable and reliable
server environment for people to use when working with threaded regionizing

Canvas is ***not*** a drop in replacement for Purpur, Paper, Leaf, or even V2/V1 of itself. Canvas V3 is a fork of Folia, and only is a drop in replacement for Folia or other forks of Folia.
