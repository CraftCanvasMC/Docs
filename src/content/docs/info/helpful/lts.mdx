# Long-Term Support (LTS) Policy

## Overview

Due to limited time for maintenance, **Canvas only supports the latest version**. Once development for a new version begins, previous versions are generally no longer maintained.

## Support Scope

* **Latest Version Focused:**
  When a new Minecraft version is being prepared, support for prior Canvas versions is dropped.

## Additional Notes

* **Critical Fixes Only:**
  Older versions may receive fixes **only** for severe issues, at the discretion of the lead developer, Dueris. Regular updates and new features will never be backported.
* **No Backports:**
  All features and improvements are developed exclusively for the latest supported version.

This approach allows Dueris to focus development efficiently while ensuring the most recent Canvas version remains stable and fully supported.
